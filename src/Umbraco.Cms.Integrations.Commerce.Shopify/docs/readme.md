# Shopify
With this Shopify integration, you can pick your favorite Shopify products to publish on your Umbraco webpage!

With this integration we provide a Shopify product(s) picker and a property value converter that uses a strongly typed model for rendering, for products within a [Shopify/ShopifyPlus](https://www.shopify.com/) store or through different custom apps from associates in the Shopify partner's program.

Once the integration is installed you can register the Shopify Product Picker as a data type and define a min/max number of products you are able to select from the content editor overlay. When the data type is registered and used across your document types you can access your store's products and publish your products on your Umbraco webpage.

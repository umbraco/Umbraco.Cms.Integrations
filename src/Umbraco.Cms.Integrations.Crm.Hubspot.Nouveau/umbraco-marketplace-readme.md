# HubSpot Forms
With this integration, you can select your favorite HubSpot form and use it to collect information on your Umbraco webpage!

This integration provides a form picker and a rendering component for forms managed through a HubSpot account, using two types of authentication: API key-based (as of November 2022, API keys are being [deprecated](https://developers.hubspot.com/changelog/upcoming-api-key-sunset) and are no longer supported), Private Access Tokens or  OAuth. 

Once the integration is installed you can go on and register a new data type based on the _HubSpot Form Picker_. After the data type is registered, you can start referencing it across your document type(s) as it will be available in the _Pickers_ section. In your content management area, you can access the forms from your HubSpot account. 

**Working with HubSpot Forms**

A form is a group of fields on your website that collects contact information that your customer-facing and marketing teams can use to build deeper relationships.

HubSpot forms integrate directly with your sales, marketing, and customer service efforts to ensure that none of your customerâ€™s valuable information gets lost and that everyone is referencing the same contact data. The information can then be used throughout the HubSpot and Umbraco ecosystems in different areas that cover your day-to-day operations. 

HubSpot Forms are available as client-side embedded scripts, for rendering within your Umbraco website

Popular features of HubSpot forms include:
- Analytics to understand how your customers interact with your forms
- Customizable calls-to-action to encourage users toward desired behaviors
- Direct integration with Salesforce & HubSpot CRM, making it easy to keep your customer data organized and up-to-date
